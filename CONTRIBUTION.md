# Image Caption Generator with Streamlit and Transformers

This repository contains a Streamlit application that uses the Transformers library from Hugging Face to generate captions for input images. The application leverages the `VisionEncoderDecoderModel` from the `nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning` pre-trained model.

## Contribution Steps

Contributions are welcome! Please open an issue or submit a pull request if you have any improvements or bug fixes.

### Describe your change:

Fixes #1. There is a bug in the code that doesn't handle the edge case when the insertion of an empty string is done.

* Fix a bug or typo in an existing algorithm?

### Checklist:

## Features

- Upload images and generate captions
- Supports various image formats (JPG, PNG, etc.)
- Utilizes the powerful Transformer architecture for image captioning

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Streamlit
- Transformers
- PyTorch
- Pillow (Python Imaging Library)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-caption-generator.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd image-caption-generator
```

3. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

2. The app will open in your default web browser. You can then upload an image, and the generated caption will be displayed.

## Deployment

To deploy the Streamlit app, follow these steps:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub.
2. Commit and push your changes to the new repository.
3. Set up a GitHub Actions workflow to build and deploy the app to GitHub Pages.

Here's an example GitHub Actions workflow file (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`):

```yaml
# Contents of .github/workflows/deploy.yml
# ... (include your GitHub Actions workflow configuration here)
```

4. After the workflow completes successfully, your Streamlit app will be deployed and accessible via the GitHub Pages URL for your repository.
