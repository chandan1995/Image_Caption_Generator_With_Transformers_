# Image Caption Generator With Transformers

This repository contains code for generating captions for images using a Transformer-based model. The model used is the `VisionEncoderDecoderModel` from the Hugging Face Transformers library, specifically the `nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning` model.

## Installation

To run this code, you'll need to install the following packages:

- [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- [Pillow (Python Imaging Library)](https://python-pillow.org/)

Certainly! Here's an updated installation section with more detailed instructions:

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Image_Caption_Generator_With_Transformers.git
```

Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username.

### 2. Install Required Packages

Navigate to the cloned repository and install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
cd Image_Caption_Generator_With_Transformers
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Download Pre-trained Model and Tokenizer

Download the pre-trained `nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning` model and tokenizer from the Hugging Face model hub using the `transformers` library:

```bash
python download_model.py
```

This will download the necessary model files and save them to the `models` directory.

### 4. Verify Installation

To verify that the installation was successful, you can run the provided example usage code:

```bash
python example_usage.py
```

This will generate captions for a sample image (`sample.jpg`) and print the captions to the console.

## Usage

1. Import the required libraries and load the pre-trained model and tokenizer:

```python
from transformers import VisionEncoderDecoderModel, ViTFeatureExtractor, AutoTokenizer
import torch
from PIL import Image
```

2. Call the `predict_step` function with a list of image paths to generate captions:

```python
captions = predict_step(['sample2.jpg'])
print(captions)
```

This will output the generated captions for the given image(s).

The provided code includes an example usage:

```python
predict_step(['sample2.jpg'])
```
