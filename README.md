# Image Caption Generator With Transformers

This repository contains code for generating captions for images using a Transformer-based model. The model used is the `VisionEncoderDecoderModel` from the Hugging Face Transformers library, specifically the `nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning` model.

## Installation

To run this code, you'll need to install the following packages:

- [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- [Pillow (Python Imaging Library)](https://python-pillow.org/)

Certainly! Here's an updated installation section with more detailed instructions:

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Image_Caption_Generator_With_Transformers.git
```

Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username.

### 2. Install Required Packages

Navigate to the cloned repository and install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
cd Image_Caption_Generator_With_Transformers
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Download Pre-trained Model and Tokenizer

Download the pre-trained `nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning` model and tokenizer from the Hugging Face model hub using the `transformers` library:

```bash
python download_model.py
```

This will download the necessary model files and save them to the `models` directory.

### 4. Verify Installation

To verify that the installation was successful, you can run the provided example usage code:

```bash
python example_usage.py
```

This will generate captions for a sample image (`sample.jpg`) and print the captions to the console.

---

## Usage

1. Import the required libraries and load the pre-trained model and tokenizer:

```python
from transformers import VisionEncoderDecoderModel, ViTFeatureExtractor, AutoTokenizer
import torch
from PIL import Image
```

2. Call the `predict_step` function with a list of image paths to generate captions:

```python
captions = predict_step(['sample2.jpg'])
print(captions)
```

This will output the generated captions for the given image(s).

The provided code includes an example usage:

```python
predict_step(['sample2.jpg'])
```

Here's an updated deployment section with more detailed instructions for deploying the Streamlit app:

---

## Deployment

### 1. Prepare Your Streamlit App

Make sure your Streamlit app (`app.py`) is ready for deployment. Ensure that it includes all necessary dependencies and functionality.

### 2. Create a Requirements File

Create a `requirements.txt` file in your project directory listing all the dependencies needed by your Streamlit app. You can generate this file using `pip freeze > requirements.txt` if you're using a virtual environment.

### 3. Set Up a GitHub Repository

If you haven't already, set up a GitHub repository for your Streamlit app. Push your `app.py` and `requirements.txt` files to this repository.

### 4. Deploy on Streamlit Sharing

1. Go to [Streamlit Sharing](https://share.streamlit.io/) and sign in with your GitHub account.
2. Click on "New app" and select your GitHub repository.
3. Configure the settings for your app (e.g., branch, path to `app.py`).
4. Click on "Deploy" to deploy your Streamlit app.

### 5. Monitor Deployment

Streamlit will start building and deploying your app. You can monitor the deployment process in the Streamlit Sharing dashboard.

### 6. View Your App

Once deployed, you can access your Streamlit app using the provided URL. Share this URL with others to showcase your app.

### 7. Update Your App

If you make changes to your app, simply push the changes to your GitHub repository. Streamlit Sharing will automatically redeploy your app with the new changes.

### 8. Manage Your App

You can manage your deployed app in the Streamlit Sharing dashboard. From here, you can view logs, change settings, and monitor usage.
